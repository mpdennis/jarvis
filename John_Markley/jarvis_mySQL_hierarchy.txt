sensorIndex is the unique identifier for each sensor. i.e. 1, 2, 67
sensorName is the readable name of the sensor. i.e. living room temperature, basement light sensor, ect.
sensorType is the type of measurement, i.e. temperature, light, sound, vibration, ect.
sensorIC is the component. i.e. LM36, photoresistor, ect.
sensorUpdatedAt is the last time the sensor was recorded to the logs. 
sensorIsDigital is whether the interface is digital or analog. i.e. true, false

logIndex is the unique identifier for each log.
sensorName is the readable name of the sensor. i.e. living room temperature, basement light sensor, ect.
sensorValue is the calculated sensor value after adjusted for the sensor. i.e. 34, 89, 60.4
sensorUoM is the unit of measurement. i.e. Celsius, Fahrenheit, percentage, Volts, Lumens, Decibels, ect.
sensorRaw this the measured value from the interface from the interface. i.e. 0.003522, 1.023445, 3.433202, ect.
sensorDateTime is the time the sensor was recorded to the logs. i.e. 
					now = datetime.datetime.now()
					sensorDateTime = now.strftime("%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S.%f")
