As a SPRINT, you do not have server access.  The schema is pretty simple.  The tables are SENSOR_DATA, SENSOR, NODE, SESSION, and USER.  I can send you the RDBMS layout later today.  The best thing for you would to be to set up on localhost and start using something called the D3 library.  Its an open source javascript library that helps with data visualization (charts/graphs), and can do animation.  Try setting up a database with some "dummy" data and see how you can work that data using that library.
